%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% URL configuration %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% URLs can be visually distinguished from normal text in one of two ways:
%%%%%
%%%%% - URLs use colored text. This ensures a consistent presentation when
%%%%%   the file is digitally viewed, but can lead to reduced print quality if the
%%%%%   file is printed with a black-and-white printer.
%%%%% - URLs use black text, with a colored frame that is only visible when the
%%%%%   file is viewed digitally. This ensures optimal print quality, while
%%%%%   highlighting the URLs only when they can actually be clicked. However, the
%%%%%   colored frames may look unappealing compared to colored text.
%%%%%
%%%%% For more information, see:
%%%%% https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Hyperlinks#Customization
%%%%%

%% Style used to display hyperlinks
% Set to "true" to make hyperlinks use colored text.
% Set to "false" to display frames around hyperlinks instead.
\newcommand{\useColoredLinks}{false}
% Width of the frames around hyperlinks
\newcommand{\urlFrameWidth}{0.1}
% Margin of the frames around hyperlinks
\newcommand{\urlFrameMargin}{0.1em}
